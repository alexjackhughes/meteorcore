# Template Application
This is a lightweight boilerplate app based off Meteor + React, so that
you don't have to do all the boring stuff like set-up accounts.

It also gives you a nice app structure so that you're projects can scale,
and you can just focus on creating new features.

## Getting Started
You've made a wise choice, *friend* - To kick it off, type the following:
`git clone https://github.com/alexjackhughes/meteorcore.git`
`cd meteor-core`
`npm start`

And you're done! Navigate to
`http://localhost:3000/`
to see the fruits of your labour! Hell, take the rest of the day off. You've earned it.
